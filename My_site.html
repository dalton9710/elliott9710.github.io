            <h2>    What you did before the bootcamp ?</h2>
            <p>Haha, i am still an undergraduate student. My major is Applied Mathematics which is about the quantitive finance. 
                Therefore, it involves numorous mathematical and statistical models with a view to forecasting and simulating the historical data. 
                Some accounting technique and portfolio hedging are also being involved. Basically, I still have one semester to go, but that is a retake subject so it won't bother my time that much (I even don't have to do revision....).
            <br></br>
                By the way, Am I the youngest student in this class :p ?</p>
            <br></br>

            <li>Finished my intership!
            <li>Finished my <strong>FYP</strong>.
            <li>Had fun with my friends!

            <h5> Why you joined the bootcamp and what you hope to achieve ?</h5>
            <h6><br></br>
                Full-stack developers are supposed to be creative and I perceive myself to have this quality. 
                So I would give it a try and to equip myself with that technical knowledge.
                Admittedly, I am not a type of person who good at computer application.
                Hopefully i will be capable of handling all the stuff in the following lessons.
                <br></br>
                Since I want to have a start-up in the future, web-building will definitely be an inevitable and essential skill for that.
                Spiritually, I hope to have a meaningful ending in 2020, registering this software engineering course will definitely be one of the best choice in the time being. 
                <br></br>
                For more personal, My cousin who is a programmer is my role models since I was young. 
                I was so wondered how he can create something from scratch. I drumed up my courage to take this course as I wanted to as masterful as him.

                <li>Be able to build a website</li>
                <li>Start my business in the future</li>

                <h2> My life and hobbies</h2>
                <p>Haha, I am such a boring person who love staying at home watching Youtube, eating food, playing games like 'Fall Guys', to name but a few. 
                    But I did play Martial Arts and Boxing in my high school. After I get into University, I hope to develop something new. 
                    <br></br>
                    When I was walking through the interest-club booths in the orientation week, I saw someone playing Locking and Hip Hop which were so fresh and charming to me.
                    Then I started playing Popping with a heart of enthusism. 
                    The reason I forgone the former two types was that I found so exhausting to follow their moves. These were too funky to handle, so I decided to walked out, OMG.
                    <br></br>
                    But then after the outbreak of the epidemic, I am gradually becoming a nerd till now. So, feel free to call me out for fun.(but not for drinks, I am so weak at drinking...)</p>

                        Story settings are imaginative and impossible in the real life but it does spark off a string of reflection on moral issues and interpersonal relationship. Not only for entertainment, but also for educational material for human being.</p></div>
